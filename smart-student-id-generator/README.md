## üß† Implementation Approach

### Form Design & Data Capture

I designed the form to be user-friendly while capturing all required data points. Each field includes proper validation, and the multi-select allergies implementation provides a seamless experience for selection and deselection.

### QR Code Integration

The QR code contains the complete student information in JSON format, making it scannable and machine-readable. This allows for quick data retrieval when scanned with a compatible device.

### Responsive Layout

The application is fully responsive, with a grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes. On small screens, the layout shifts to a vertical orientation for better user experience.

### Persistent Storage

Student data is stored in localStorage, allowing for:
- Retrieval of previously generated ID cards
- Searchable list of students
- Managing (viewing/deleting) existing cards

### Accessibility

Special attention was paid to accessibility features including:
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Semantic HTML elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly elements

## üìà Future Enhancements

Given more time, the application could be enhanced with:
- Authentication for multi-user support
- Backend integration for cloud storage
- Bulk ID card generation
- Custom template creation
- PDF export for multiple cards
- Barcode scanner integration for quick access
